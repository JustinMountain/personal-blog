# Personal Blog as a Next.js Web Application

This is the repository for my personal site. It's been built as a Next.js web application which you can view on at [https://justinmountain.com](https://justinmountain.com/).

If you're interested in reading the documentation for the app, it can be found [in the repository]() or on the [live application]().
