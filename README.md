# Personal Blog as a Next.js Web Application

This is the repository for my personal site. It's been built as a Next.js web application which you can view on [GitHub pages](https://justinmountain.github.io/personal-blog/).

If you're interested in reading the documentation for the app, it can be found [in the repository](https://github.com/JustinMountain/personal-blog/blob/main/posts/proxmox.md) or on the [live application](/posts/creating-a-nextjs-blog).
