### Table of Contents

### Intro

I use RBC, which only lets me retrieve a certain amount of file through their system. I found a [script on GitHub](https://github.com/mindcruzer/rbc-statement-to-csv) which takes e-Statements from RBC credit cards and converts them into one large `.csv` file which I could import into Actual.

For Debit and Savings accounts, I used the filter funciton on the Account Summary page to select the range I wanted to import, loaded all of the entries for my range, copied them into Excel and created the appropriate columns.

Moving forward I will go to **My Accounts** > **Account Services** menu > **Download transactions**. I can choose `.ofx` or `.qfx` filetypes, though since CIBC exports to `.qfx` I will likely use that one for consistency.

CIBC Import didn't include two transactions. Data was taken on 2024/07/20, items actually purchased on the 19th, and posted on 22. I need to double check that these items actually get withdrawn next time I pull from CIBC.

Go to **More** on the left side, select **Download Transactions**
